                <p><strong>THE KEY IS ADAPTING </strong>
                Each layer of the key is made with extreme precision,
                accuracy and overal skill. At ION Designs, each key
                can take up to 20 hours to construct. The top layer
                being a crucial aspect; coated with waterpoof, scratch proof,
                armored and electronic disruption proofed. </p>

            	<h1>Limitless memory, becomes limitless control.</h1>
                <p><strong>THE KEY IS LIMITLESS </strong>
                With each layer added onto the Key, it becomes faster,
				more powerful and stronger. In this layer instance, we 
                have added 128GB of non-volatile RAM that will store all
                required data and more, even when turned off. Carbon nanotubes
                used to keep the memory stored, whereas normal RAM will delete
                all memory after shutdown. This keep the Key from needing to 
                reset and the need for more RAM.

            	<h1>Intelligence beyond our own, almost artificial.</h1>
                <p><strong>THE KEY IS TRANSCENDENT </strong>
				In all chips, there is a cpu, the brain of the machine,
                in our case it is a super computer the size of a seed.
                This layer being prized above all, is the brain and the intelect
                of the Key. ION Designs created an entirely new CPU that processes
                faster than anything the world has seen in this size. It will
                understand, process and give feedback within nanoseconds.

            	<h1>Almost nothing is sacred, except our minds.</h1>
                <p><strong>THE KEY IS UNRESTRICTED  </strong>
                All microchips are small, the size of a nail on a small
                child, but beyond large in capacity. With the Key, size
                is important. This layer of the chip is surgically attached
                to the users wrist, and allows the neural connection between
                the Key and the user. The procecdure is beyond delicate, but
                also not physically, but mentally painful. The connection
                between the Key and the user is a connection between two minds;
                where the user is in complete control.

                <p><strong>THE KEY IS INFINITE </strong>
                Wireless technology has advanced almost every single year
                since its first existant, but for the first time since its
                existance, it will become fullproof. With the second last
                layer of the Key comes the wireless technology built into it.
                Our wireless will reach its linked devices anywhere in the world,
                within seconds. Loading times are obsolete and elevators are now
                open fields. So goodbye to Wireless AC and welcome Infinity.

            	<h1>Security is a figment of our imagination.</h1>
                <p><strong>THE KEY IS SECURE</strong>
				The need for security has exploded since the dawn of the
                internet, and now more than ever, security and privacy
                no longer exist, until now. The Key is the most secure,
                private device ever created. Its data is all output, securely
                over an encrypted network that can only be accessed with
                neural waves, that only the user has. Input occurs on rare
                occasions, during set-up and shutdown. During set-up
                the users neural-net is fused into the chip.
                Welcome the new private, secure Frontier Chip.
